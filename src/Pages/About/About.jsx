            Hello! I'm a web developer passionate about creating interactive and responsive web applications.
            With experience in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more, I enjoy solving complex problems and learning new technologies.

            When I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games or watching anime. I believe in continuous learning and am always looking to expand my knowledge in the world of web development.
